Installed items are stored in:
```
/server/storage/plugins/agent-skills/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ skill-id-1/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ plugin.json    # Configuration
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ handler.js     # Skill code
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ skill-id-2/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ plugin.json
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ handler.js
```

## Testing the Marketplace

   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Backend
   yarn dev:server
   
   # Terminal 2: Frontend
   cd frontend && yarn dev
   ```

2. **Access the marketplace**:

4. **Test in workspace**:
   - Create or open a workspace
   - Go to Workspace Settings ‚Üí Agent Configuration
   - Verify the installed skill appears

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
If you see "Port 3000 is in use", the frontend is using port 3003 instead.

### Authentication Required
Some endpoints require admin authentication. Make sure you're logged in as an admin user.

### Skills Not Showing in Workspace
1. Check if the skill is enabled in the "Installed" tab
2. Refresh the workspace settings page
3. Ensure the skill's `active` flag is set to `true`

## Development

To modify the marketplace:

### Frontend Components
- Main page: `/frontend/src/pages/GeneralSettings/CommunityHub/MarketplaceView/index.jsx`
- Skill card: `/frontend/src/pages/GeneralSettings/CommunityHub/MarketplaceView/SkillCard.jsx`
- Installed items: `/frontend/src/pages/GeneralSettings/CommunityHub/MarketplaceView/InstalledSkills.jsx`

### Backend Endpoints
- API routes: `/server/endpoints/communityHub.js`
- Model: `/server/models/communityHub.js`
- Plugin system: `/server/utils/agents/imported.js`

### Adding New Features
The marketplace is built on top of the existing CommunityHub infrastructure, so any new features should:
1. Extend the CommunityHub model
2. Use the existing ImportedPlugin system
3. Follow the existing authentication patterns

## Next Steps
