# Agent System Comparison: Original vs Modified

## Original AnythingLLM Design

### Original System Prompt
```
You are a helpful ai assistant who can assist the user and use tools available to help answer the users prompts and questions.
```
- **Simple and clean**
- **No forcing behavior**
- **Natural agent flow**

### Original Execution Flow
```javascript
// handleExecution in aibitat/index.js
async handleExecution(provider, messages, functions, byAgent) {
  const completion = await provider.complete(messages, functions);
  
  if (completion.functionCall) {
    // Execute function
    let result = await fn.handler(args);
    // Recurse naturally
    return await this.handleExecution(provider, [...messages, {role: "function", content: result}], functions, byAgent);
  }
  
  // Return text and END
  return completion.result;
}
```

### Original Philosophy
- Agent decides when to continue or stop
- Recursive until LLM returns text instead of function call
- Trust the LLM's judgment
- Clean separation of concerns

## What We Changed (Problems Created)

### 1. Complex System Prompt
- Added multi-action rules
- Added THINK → ACT → OBSERVE pattern 
- Added [CONTINUE] directives
- Added forcing instructions
- **Problem**: Overloading the LLM with conflicting instructions

### 2. Multiple Plugins for Same Thing
- `execute-multi-step.js` - Interceptor approach
- `agent-loop.js` - Progress tracking
- `flow-orchestrator.js` - Workflow management
- **Problem**: Three ways to do the same thing, confusing the agent

### 3. Forced Continuation Logic
```javascript
// We added forced recursion
if (needsContinuation) {
  const forceMessage = {role: "system", content: "You MUST call the function again"};
  return await this.handleExecution(provider, [...messages, forceMessage], functions, byAgent);
}
```
- **Problem**: Fighting against the LLM's natural decision-making

### 4. Result Manipulation
```javascript
// We're modifying function results to force behavior
result = `Sent to ${justProcessed}. INCOMPLETE - Still need to send to: ${remaining.join(', ')}`;
```
- **Problem**: Confusing the LLM with artificial messages

## The Core Issue

The agent stops after one action because:
1. **LLM decides** to return text after first success ("I'll now send to the second...")
2. **System exits** the recursive loop when text is returned
3. **Session ends** waiting for user input

## Better Solution: Proactive Continuation

Instead of forcing, we should:

### 1. Keep Simple System Prompt
```
You are a helpful AI assistant. When handling multiple similar actions:
- Complete ALL requested actions before responding
- Provide progress updates after each action
- Continue automatically until all tasks are done
```

### 2. Single Progress Tracking System
```javascript
// Track what's been done and what's pending
class AgentTaskTracker {
  constructor(request) {
    this.originalRequest = request;
    this.detectTasks();
  }
  
  detectTasks() {
    // Parse request for multiple actions
    this.totalTasks = this.extractTasks(this.originalRequest);
    this.completedTasks = [];
  }
  
  onTaskComplete(task) {
    this.completedTasks.push(task);
    
    if (this.hasMoreTasks()) {
      return {
        continue: true,
        message: `✓ ${task} complete. ${this.remaining()} tasks remaining...`,
        nextTask: this.getNextTask()
      };
    }
    
    return {
      continue: false,
      message: `All ${this.totalTasks.length} tasks completed successfully!`
    };
  }
}
```

### 3. Proactive Updates to User
```javascript
// Send progress updates via WebSocket
if (taskTracker.hasMoreTasks()) {
  socket.send(JSON.stringify({
    type: 'progress',
    message: `Completed ${taskTracker.completedTasks.length}/${taskTracker.totalTasks.length} tasks`,
    status: 'continuing'
  }));
  
  // Continue with next task WITHOUT waiting for user
  continueExecution();
}
```

### 4. Natural Continuation
```javascript
// In handleExecution, check if more work is needed
if (completion.functionCall) {
  let result = await fn.handler(args);
  
  // Check if this was part of a multi-task request
  if (this.taskTracker?.hasMoreTasks()) {
    // Add progress message but keep going
    result = `${result}\n\nContinuing with remaining tasks...`;
  }
  
  return await this.handleExecution(provider, [...messages, {role: "function", content: result}], functions, byAgent);
}
```

## Recommended Approach

1. **Remove all forcing logic**
2. **Simplify system prompt back to basics**
3. **Add single task tracker that detects multi-part requests**
4. **Send progress updates via WebSocket**
5. **Let agent naturally continue through recursive execution**
6. **Trust the LLM but guide it with clear task tracking**

## Key Principle

**Don't force the agent - guide it with clear information about what's been done and what remains.**

The agent should:
- Know what tasks exist
- Track what's complete
- See what remains
- Naturally continue until done
- Send progress updates along the way
