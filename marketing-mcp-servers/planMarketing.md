  Workspace: "Q1-2025-Campaign"
  ├── Documents: brand-guidelines.pdf,
  competitor-analysis.xlsx
  ├── System Prompt: "You are a marketing strategist
   for [brand]..."
  ├── Chat History: Strategy discussions & content
  generation
  └── Settings: Platform credentials, publishing
  schedule

  Step 4: Extend Existing UI

  - Add "Marketing Mode" toggle in workspace
  settings
  - Show calendar view in chat sidebar
  - Display analytics in existing metrics section

  Implementation Using ONLY Existing Features:

  1. Ingestion: MCP servers fetch data → Store as
  workspace documents
  2. Strategy: Chat with agent using workspace
  context
  3. Content: Generate via chat, store versions in
  documents
  4. Planning: Agent skill reads/writes schedule to
  workspace
  5. Publishing: MCP servers handle distribution
  6. Analytics: MCP servers fetch metrics → Store as
   documents

  Benefits of This Approach:

  - ✅ No core system changes needed
  - ✅ Leverages existing auth, permissions,
  multi-tenancy
  - ✅ Uses proven MCP/Agent architecture
  - ✅ Workspaces provide perfect isolation
  - ✅ Vector DB already handles memory
  - ✅ Chat UI already supports rich interactions

  Quick Start Implementation:

⏺ Write(marketing-mcp-servers/meta-mcp.js)
  ⎿  Wrote 211 lines to                            
     marketing-mcp-servers/meta-mcp.js
     #!/usr/bin/env node
     /**
      * Meta/Instagram MCP Server
      * Integrates with existing AnythingLLM MCP 
     infrastructure
      */
     const { Server } = require('@modelcontextprotoc
     ol/sdk/server/index.js');
     const { StdioServerTransport } = require('@mode
     lcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js');
     class MetaMCPServer {
     … +201 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ This approach:
  1. Uses existing MCP infrastructure for all
  external integrations
  2. Leverages workspaces as campaign containers
  3. Extends agents with marketing skills
  4. Reuses chat interface for content generation
  5. Stores everything in existing document/vector
  DB system

  No need to build new systems - just add
  marketing-specific MCPs and agent skills on top of
   what's already there!
